    "We haven't talked about functions yet, so this is a pretty annoying \"roll with it\" stage.  I personally wouldn't have incorporated this style so quickly in the book, but in an effort to be coherent, we'll use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep your indents in order.\n",
    "    * Everything tabbed in under the `def` line will 'belong' to that function.\n",
    "* None of the code within the `def main():` block will run if you don't 'call' the function.\n",
    "    * Perfect looking script executing without an output?  This is likely the culprit.\n",
    "    * You need to have a `main()` as your last line of code without any indents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(\"fizzy pop sandwich\")\n",
    "    # more code goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "main() # last line, no indents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This style of script construction is not _required_ for Python, but will seem more logical as we go on and build more complex programs."
