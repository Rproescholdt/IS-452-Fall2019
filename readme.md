# IS 452: Foundations of Information Processing - Spring 2018 

A public repo for the my Spring 2018 IS452 lecture notes

## Status

This was imported from the Fall and the content will be reviewed before class.  Right now, the schedule has not been set.

## About

This is the repo for the IS452 A/AO class materials that I can make public, but mainly for the notebooks containing my lecure notes and occasionaly slides.

I will add the completed (or in progress toward being completed) notebooks as links in the schedule.  For my own reference I've added a folder with the spring notebooks.

Jupyter notebooks should render nicely inside of github, but you'll need to download and open any powerpoint slides.
