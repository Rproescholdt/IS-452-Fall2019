# IS 452: Foundations of Information Processing - Spring 2018 

A public repo for the my Spring 2018 IS452 lecture notes

## Status

This was imported from the Fall and the content will be reviewed before class in a Just In Time fashion.

## About

This is the repo for the IS452 A/AO class materials that I can make public, but mainly for the notebooks containing my lecure notes and occasionaly slides.  This doesn't contain everything for the class.
