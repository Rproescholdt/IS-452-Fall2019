Finally, you put the packet into the box holding all the completed packets.\n",

Your job is to keep adding toppings to the sandwhich until they tell you they are done. You don't know how many times you'll add stuff to the sandwich, but you'll know when they say they are done.

You're still standing there with a bunch of shoes in your hand.  \n",

This allows it to reset everytime we hit a new group.\n",
