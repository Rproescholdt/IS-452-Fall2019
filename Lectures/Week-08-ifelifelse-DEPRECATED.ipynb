    "Last week we covered the core concepts of using booleans in our programs.  We covered if/else, and today we'll cover expanding this into the if/elif/else combination.  This allows us to create larger boolean blocks to have more precise control over the processing flow of our program.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That `else` there belongs to the if block, and will only execute when that `if` condition is false.  Keeping these two conditions together and dependent on eachother will give us tighter control over our logical checks.  This is effectively saying that there is only one question at hand, and there are 2 possible answers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many cases where we have a single question but there are many possible answers.  This is where `elif` comes in.  It is short for \"else if\", and like the `else` statement, will only be attempted if the statement before it has a conditional check evaluate to False.  It may only appear after an if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Core if/elif model\n",
    "* `elif`: short for 'else if', may come after an `if` block and should be on the same indent level as the parent `if` block.  Must be followed by a conditional check.  I almost always include an `else` statement with this structure, but it is not required.  Example usage:\n",
