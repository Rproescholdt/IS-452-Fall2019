    "# What's our structure here?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've got data on datasets here, but this isn't a tabular data file.  We can't open it up in excel or directly do computations on it, yet.  We need to transform it into something with a standard sturucture for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of lines per entry is variable, so we can't exploit a steady mathematical structure like we did with the Raven last week.\n",
    "* even if variable, we can see that the lines inside each entry are meaningful \n",
    "* each line has a field label followed by a : and then content\n",
    "* some of these fields have multiple entries (so multiple lines with the same field entry)\n",
    "* some of the line content has multiple values\n",
    "* the string \"-----\" appears (to appear!) between each entry\n",
    "\n",
    "# What's our data granularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we explored a poem and found that our unit of analysis of interest are the individual lines.  That made it easy because python knows about lines and has functions designed to easily interact with them.  In this case, our individual data entities records about the dataset.  This sort of thing, especially with the variability in size, is not something that python is able to directly interact with.  Our recourse for this issue is to use the tools inside of python to encode these chunks as individual data entries.  Once we have the individual records out we can operate on them independently and exract the information out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern of breaking the data apart so that we can apply broader (easier) methods of splitting individual data points out will be a common one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to consider the Raven again.  Say that we want to know about the words in each stanza.  We could use regular `.split()` on the entire poem and get all the words.  We'd have the granularity that we want (the words) but the membership information would then be gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our basic for loop over lines through the poem:  it allows us to isolate each line at a time such that we can manupulate or take measurements from that line and infer that those measurements we get belong to that line because it is the one we are looping over at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example of why using the `range(0, len(raven_lines), 7)` function to make the position numbers and look up the line versus just doing a list slice (`::7`) gave us the same content back (the first line of each stanza), but using the list slicing method lost the line number information in the process.  That origin information could not be derived back from the individual line itself, and thus we depend on our iterable variable within the `range` loop to represent that component metadata about the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike our pattern where we used `range` to generate the line numbers, the content (the numbers) that we generated with `range` wasn't directly related to our original content.  We used a known pattern to (correctly!) generate postiton numbers.  So there was a certain trust that we had to put into place to make the things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time around we are splitting our data into chunks so that we can individually act on the data inside of it.  This means that instead of getting out all the lines that have the funder information and doing something fancy to figure out which chunk it was from, we can take out all the chunks and then get the funder lines from there.  Becuase we are isolating the data records from eachother, we can use a pretty unfancy method of getting out the lines that we want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the last line of each record is the download count for that dataset.  That location rule would be impossible to use if we weren't isolating each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to answer our question:  we have several granularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each data record\n",
    "2. Each line\n",
    "3. Each data point in each line\n",
