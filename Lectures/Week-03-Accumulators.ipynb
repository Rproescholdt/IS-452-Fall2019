    "* Take a look at the first research essay due next Thursday.  This one is on Python vs Java.  It is meant to give you some exposure to what Java is, when it is used, and some of the essential differences between the two languages.  To be clear, you do not need to learn Java for this assignment.  I expect that you will look at examples of Java code, perhaps skim a tutorial, but I don't expect you to install it or try to write any Java code.  You're very welcome to do so if you'le curious, etc.  So you don't need to know Java to complete this essay!\n",

    "Some admin notes on the essay:\n",
    "\n",
    "* while the essays are due at staggard times throughout the semester, you cannot pick and choose which topics to turn in at those intervals.  Each topic is due at the specific time that the assignment is due.\n",
    "* recall that only 2 of these essays are required, so you can skip any one that you'd like, or do all 3 and have the lowest score replaced.\n",

    "# Essential pattern:  minimal accumulator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting up by a number\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to explore this solution with another pattern:  the accumulator.  Sectien 3.3 of the book has a similar formula, which is a completely fine version.  I have one nitpick with it that I will expand on later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "counter = 0 # your counter variable at the initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "for something in sequence: # loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # do all the things\n",
    "    counter = 1 + counter # update the counter, replace 1 and/or the operator with whatever you need\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "My nitpick about the Zelle formula is that it leaves out the `do stuff` item.  You are often having to do more than just update your counter variable, so you need to remember that you put this update at the end of your `for` loop block.  This updating action should almost always be the last thing that you `for` loop does.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example is counting up by 1, but you can always change what that number is or what the operator is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting letters\n",
    "\n",
    "When a data type has the ability to be 'added' to, either through the `+` operator or a method (which is something to be explored later), you can use this same kind of pattern.  Instead of setting the counter to `0`, you have an 'empty' whatever-it-is.  Since we've been playing with strings lately, let's use that as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "new_string = \"\" # your empty string\n",
    "\n",
    "for letter in \"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\": # loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # maybe you're filtering for letter characters\n",
    "    new_string = new_string + letter # update the counter, replace 1 and/or the operator with whatever you need\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than not having numbers, you'll notice just one difference in this example:  I'm using `new_string = new_string + letter` whereas the counter had `thingtoadd = 1 + thingtoadd`.  So whereas numercial addition can have any order (Commutative Property) when you have 2 things to add, order does matter with string concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"fizzy\" + \"pop\"` makes `\"fizzypop\"` and `\"pop\" + \"fizzy\"` makes `\"popfizzy\"`.  So the order that you decide to write the operation will determine what you get and should be part of your design process.  Most of the time you'll want to add new things on to the end, so:  `current + new`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting other stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern will be used all over as we move forward in class.  What will change is what the collection item is (a string, a sum, a file, list, etc), what you're adding to the thing, and what you need to do to create the thing you want to add to your collection.  Here's a more abstract formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "collection_thing = ?? # declare an empty version of your collection thing \n",
    "# thin may also be opening an empty file to write out to\n",
    "\n",
    "for thing in sequence: # loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # transform, filter, etc\n",
    "    ??? # put your new data in your collection thing\n",

Without direct access to the content in this process, we're kind of stuck with that spacing.  So we would have needed to do the cleanup earlier in our process (sometimes we've already been in there messing with stuff before we do our filtering, so this isn't a concern in the final prep preocess) but other times we haven't needed to touch the content before this point (which is our current situation).  This is a place where your personal style will come into play a lot.  You may have already deast with this, or had a better opportunity to deal with this, depending on what you might have needed to do in your program before this point.
